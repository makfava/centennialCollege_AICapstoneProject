      "description": "The City of Toronto's Transportation Services Division collects short-term traffic count data across the City on an ad-hoc basis to support a variety of safety initiatives and projects.\r\n\r\nThe data available in this repository are a full collection of Speed, Volume and Classification Counts conducted across the City since 1993.\r\n\r\nThe two most common types of short-term traffic counts are Turning Movement Counts and Speed / Volume / Classification Counts.\r\n\r\n*[Turning Movement Count data, comprised of motor vehicle, bicycle and pedestrian movements through intersections, can be found here](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/traffic-volumes-at-intersections-for-all-modes/).*\r\n\r\nSpeed / Volume / Classification Counts are collected using pneumatic rubber tubes installed across the roadway.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is a critical input into transportation safety initiatives, infrastructure design and program design such as speed limit changes, signal coordination studies, traffic calming and complete street designs.\r\n\r\nEach Speed / Volume / Classification Count is comprised of motor vehicle count data collected over a continuous 24-hour to 168-hour period (1-7 days), at a single location. A handful of non-standard 2-week counts are also included. Some key notes about these counts include:\r\n\r\n- Not all counts have complete speed and classification data. These data are provided for locations and dates only where they exist.\r\n- Raw data are recorded in 15-minute intervals.\r\n- Raw data are recorded separately for each direction of traffic movement. Some data are only available for one direction, even if the street is two-way.\r\n- Within each 15 minute interval, speed data are aggregated into approximately 5 km/h increments.\r\n- Within each 15 minute interval, classification data are aggregated into vehicle type bins by the number of axles, according to the FHWA classification system attached below.\r\n\r\nThe following files showing different views of the data are available:\r\n\r\n- **Data Dictionary (*svc\\_data\\_dictionary.xlsx*)**: Provides a detailed definition of every data field in all files.\r\n- **Summary Data (*svc\\_summary\\_data*)**: Provides metadata about every Speed / Volume / Classification Count available, including information about the count location and count date, as well as summary data about each count (total vehicle volumes, average daily volumes, a.m. and p.m. peak hour volumes, average / 85 percentile / 95 percentile speeds, where available, and heavy vehicle percentage, where available).\r\n- **Most Recent Count Data (*svc\\_most\\_recent\\_summary\\_data*):** Provides metadata about the most recent Speed / Volume / Classification Count data available at each location for which a count exists, including information about the count location and count date, as well as the summary data provided in the “Summary Data” file (see above).\r\n-   **Raw Data:** Raw data is available in 15-minute intervals, and is distributed into one of three different file types based on the count type: volume-only, speed and volume, or classification and volume.\r\n    \r\n    -   If you’re looking for 15-minute data for a specific count, identify the count type and count date, then download the raw data file associated with the count type and period.\r\n        \r\n    -   If you’re looking for volume data for all count types, you will need to download and aggregate all three file types for a given period.\r\n        \r\n    -   **Volume Raw Data (**_**svc\\_raw\\_data\\_volume\\_yyyy\\_yyyy**_**):** These files—grouped by 5-10 year interval—provide volume data in 15-minute intervals, for each direction separately.

      "url": "https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/daily-shelter-overnight-service-occupancy-capacity/",
      "description": "This data set provides a daily list of active overnight shelter and allied services in the Toronto Shelter and Support Services division's Shelter Management Information System (SMIS) database. The data provides daily updated information about shelter and overnight service programs administered by TSSS including the program's operator, location, classification, occupancy and capacity.\r\nThis reporting revises and updates the approach taken in the [Daily Shelter Occupancy data set] (https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/daily-shelter-occupancy/), starting with the current year data for 2021. This new data set includes the following revisions:\r\n\r\n* __Overnight service type:__ The previous data set only reported on shelter programs, now all overnight service types where occupancy is tracked in SMIS are included.\r\n\r\n* __Capacity type:__ Programs are categorized in this data set as having either bed based or room based capacity. Bed based capacity is typically applicable for programs with common sleeping areas, while room based capacity is typically applicable for family programs and hotel programs where sleeping rooms are not shared by people from different households. This change prevents over reporting of capacity in room based programs.\r\n\r\n* __Two measures of capacity:__ This data set provides information about two measures of capacity. __Funding__ capacity reports the number of beds or rooms that a program is intended to provide. This is also the capacity measure provided in the previous Daily Shelter Occupancy data set. There are a number of reasons why beds or rooms may be temporarily out of service, including maintenance, repairs, renovations, outbreaks or pest control, so a second capacity measure is also included in the reporting. __Actual__ capacity reports the number of beds or rooms in service and showing as available for occupancy in the Shelter Management Information System at time of reporting. The previous data set reported only funding capacity, but actual capacity is a more effective capacity measure to assess program occupancy rates.\r\n\r\n### Definitions\r\nDefinitions for each field in the data set are provided under data features. Additional definitions about housing & homelessness services can be found in the Housing & Homelessness Services Glossary, which you can find on the [Housing Stability Service System Overview](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/research-reports/housing-and-homelessness-research-and-reports/housing-stability-service-system-map-and-terms/) web page.\r\n",

Toronto is the first city\r\nin North America to have a by-law requiring and governing the construction of\r\ngreen roofs. The bylaw applies to new commercial, institutional and many\r\nresidential development applications and to certain developments not completed\r\nbefore the bylaw came into effect on Jan 31, 2010\r\n\r\nThe Eco-Roof Incentive Program provides incentives to support the installation of green roofs and cool roofs on Toronto homes and buildings. Known collectively as eco-roofs, these technologies along with other City strategies help to make Toronto more resilient and better adapted to climate change. To learn more and access funding to support your project please visit [Eco-Roof Incentive Program](https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/water-environment/environmental-grants-incentives/green-your-roof/).\r\n\r\nData for Eco-Roof Incentive Program are updated quarterly while all green roofs are updated weekly.

During evaluations, Bylaw Enforcement Officers inspect common areas, mechanical and security systems, parking and exterior grounds.\r\n\r\nIn 2023, RentsafeTO updated its evaluation process. Buildings must undergo evaluation at least once every two years, increasing the number of evaluation categories to 50 and allocating a weight to the category.\r\n\r\nEach category item is inspected and assigned a score from one to three with one being the lowest and three being the highest. At times, an item may be assigned a score of 0 if it cannot be evaluated due to an obstruction or refusal to inspect. Additionally, if an item is not applicable to the building at the time of evaluation, the score will show as blank in the dataset.\r\n\r\nTo download data from building evaluations before 2023, please download “Pre-2023 Apartment Building Evaluations\" and “Apartment Building Evaluations 2023 - current” to download data from building evaluations from 2023 and beyond.\r\n\r\nLearn more about [RentSafeTO: Evaluation Tool – City of Toronto](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/housing-shelter/rental-housing-tenant-information/rental-housing-standards/apartment-building-standards/rentsafeto-evaluation-tool/).",

Each row of the spreadsheet describes a course of a registered program. Course_ID is unique identifier. Recreational programs fall under various categories. A registered program course runs under an activity, on schedule, and has boundaries in regards age of a registrant. You can get information on course location from Locations tab by LocationID. There are multiple courses running at one location.\n  2. **Drop-in**. Each row of the spreadsheet describes a drop-in course. Drop-In Course is a program offered within PFR facilities where registration is not required. Drop-In Participation is an informal involvement in a program where space may permit in an activity, and allow for a pay as you go option (e.g. fitness class, Aquafit class). A drop-in course runs under a category, on schedule, and has boundaries in regards age of registrants. You can get information on course location from Locations tab by LocationID.

A location has a name, is characterized by a type (park, rec centre), address, and short description, may be fully or partially accessible, and may have a parent location.\n  4. **Facilities**. Each row of the spreadsheet describes a facility. FacilityID is unique identifier. Facility is described by a Type (Display Name) and has multiple assets. 'Facility Rating' column contains values of facility rates (used to learn about amenities that might be available at each facility  - see metadata).

Healthcare institutions must also actively look for, detect and report suspected and/or confirmed outbreaks to their local public health unit.  An outbreak is defined as a localized increase (e.g. in an institution, or a specific ward or floor within an institution) in the rate of infection or illness, above that which is expected.\r\n\r\nUnder the HPPA, Toronto Public Health is required to respond to reports of suspected and confirmed outbreaks of gastroenteric and respiratory illness. Toronto Public Health works with healthcare institutions to prevent and control institutional outbreaks, including the use of best practices in infection prevention and control.\r\n\r\nThe most recent dataset is updated weekly on Thursdays with data as of the Wednesday at 2pm.\r\n\r\n\\*Please note that all instances of \"Coronavirus\\*\" in the datasets refer to the seasonal coronavirus, commonly identified as a causative agent for institutional respiratory outbreaks, and not COVID-19.\r\n",

It does not encompass all areas protected by the Ravine and Natural Feature Protection By-Law, by Environmentally Significant Areas or by Natural Heritage Areas.  \r\n\r\nGreen Spaces is primarily intended to visualize our existing overall parks and open space system.

It will also help measure progress towards the vision of reducing homelessness in Toronto to rare, brief, and non-recurring instances. \r\n\r\nOver time, the data will be expanded to capture more people, such as people sleeping outdoors and people using overnight homelessness services that are not funded by the City of Toronto to provide more comprehensive picture of all people experiencing homelessness in Toronto.

These two data sets provide information about calls received by Central Intake, the outcomes of those calls, and the number of individuals who could not be matched to a shelter space each day.\r\n\r\nThe first, **Central Intake Service Queue Data**, provides counts of the number of unique individuals who contacted Central Intake to access emergency shelter but were not matched to a shelter space. Generated through Central Intake caseworkers' use of the City's Shelter Management Information System (SMIS), the data are reported as a count for every operational day.\r\n\r\nThe SMIS service queue for Central Intake records when a bed is requested for a caller seeking a shelter space. Those callers who could not be matched to an available space that suits their needs at the time of their call remain in the queue until they can be provided a referral or until the closeout process at the end of the night (i.e. 4:00 a.m.).\r\n\r\nService Queue data combines data exported from the Central Intake service queue at 4:00 a.m., with manually coded outcome data based on the review of each individual's SMIS records for the day. SSHA began collecting data on how many people remain unmatched in the service queue over a 24 hour period at the beginning of November 2020. Given the manual nature of the preparation of the data in this data set, this file will be updated on a monthly basis. Data will be reported separately for every operational day in that month.\r\n\r\nThe second data set, **Central Intake Call Wrap-Up Codes Data**, provides counts of calls answered by Central Intake, classified by the nature of the call.  When a call is handled by a caseworker at Central Intake, the caseworker assigns a wrap-up code to the call. This tracking allows for analysis of call trends.\r\n\r\nCentral Intake uses 13 distinct wrap-up codes to code the calls they receive. This data set provides a daily summary of the number of calls received by each call wrap-up code. The data are manually retrieved from the City's call centre database reports. Given the manual nature of the preparation of the data in this data set, this file will be updated on a monthly basis. Data will be reported separately for every operational day in that month.\r\n\r\nPlease note that while the wrap-up codes provide information related to the volume and type of calls answered by Central Intake, the data do not track requests made by unique individuals nor the ultimate outcomes of referrals.\r\n\r\nPlease also note that the previews and Data Features below only show information pertaining to the Central Intake Call Wrap-Up Codes Data dataset.\r\n",

This includes vaccinations for measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, tetanus, polio, pertussis (whooping cough), meningococcal and varicella (chicken pox). As a result, each year Toronto Public Health staff work with schools located in the City of Toronto to assess student immunization records to ensure that all students are a) up-to-date with their required immunization and/or b) a valid exemption for philosophical or medical reasons is provided, in accordance with the ISPA. Toronto Public Health also offers hepatitis B, human papillomavirus (HPV) and meningococcal vaccines to grade 7 and 8 students at school clinics through the School Immunization Program (SIP).\r\n\r\nThis data represents Immunization Coverage Rates and exemptions for School pupils (7-17 year olds) in Toronto for the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 school years. For the 2023/2024 school year, this data represents the immunization coverage rates and exemptions for ISPA vaccines for school pupils in grade 2 and grade 12 and the immunization coverage rates for SIP vaccines for school pupils in grade 8 and grades 10-12.

Urban Forestry has had requests to determine ownership of trees within the road allowance, and where this has confirmed private ownership, these trees may be in the database as well for future reference.\r\n\r\nThe dataset is limited to the City of Toronto boundaries and is best utilized when overlaid with the City's Street Centreline file. This shape file should not be used for ownership verification. The positioning shown is not accurate as the tree data has been geographically coded to the parcel address, and this will incorrectly indicate the tree location within the private parcel. The Toronto Street Tree data is compiled by Urban Forestry staff during their inspections or tree maintenance work on trees located on City owned street allowances. The database is large covering over 530,000 records and annually Urban Forestry can only update the volume that is worked on. Some data may be several years old and have not been updated recently, so there may be inaccuracies with the data as a result.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**_Note:_** _We are currently updating and improving street tree location information. This is an ongoing process; therefore, some trees may still appear mapped to the address point, whereas others will be mapped in their physical location along the street. For more information please contact Urban Forestry._\r\n\r\n**_Downloading_** _This is a fairly large data set. If you have any issues (like a timeout) using the dynamic file downloader (the first link in the \"Download Data\" section) feel free to use the **Alternate Files**._\r\n\r\n \r\n",

The primary purpose of the City-designated social planning neighbourhoods is to help City staff collect data, plan, analyze and forecast City services. While these neighbourhoods may not fully encompass every historical neighbourhood area, they do provide a way for planners and researchers to track information about them over time.\r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood profiles were developed to help government and community agencies with their local planning, by providing socio-economic data at a meaningful geographic area. Unlike other geographies like wards or dissemination blocks, the boundaries of these social planning neighbourhoods change very infrequently over time, allowing researchers to perform longitudinal studies to see the changes in each area. Not all people define neighbourhoods the same way, but for the purposes of statistical reporting these neighbourhoods were defined based on [Statistics Canada census tracts](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/ref/dict/geo013-eng.cfm).\r\n\r\nFor more information visit our [About Toronto's Neighbourhoods](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/neighbourhoods-communities/neighbourhood-profiles/) page.\"\r\n",

A summary of the network status is available at toronto.ca/cyclingnetwork \r\n\r\nThe Toronto bikeways dataset contains the following types of bikeways: cycle tracks, bicycle lanes (including buffered bike lanes and contra-flow bike lanes), neighbourhood routes with sharrows (including wayfinding sharrows), multi-use trails (including off-road and in-boulevard), as well as signed cycling routes. \r\n\r\nThere are two fields that reference the bikeway type because some streets have different infrastructure on each side of the roadway. \"INFRA-HIGH\" refers to the highest classified cycling infrastructure type installed on this segment. \"INFRA-LOW\" refers to the lowest classified cycling infrastructure type. The hierarchy is based on the quality and comfort of the bikeway type, with routes that are shared with vehicles as the lowest comfort, and the greater the separation / dedicated space, the higher the comfort and classification.\r\n\r\nFor example, on a contra-flow bike lane route with sharrows in the other direction, the highest classified cycling infrastructure type on this street is the contra-flow bike lane, and the lower order infrastructure is the sharrows. If the street has the same type of cycling infrastructure on both sides, then the input is the same for both \"INFRA-LOW\" and \"INFRA-HIGH\". If there is a bikeway on only one side of a street, the bikeway type is listed under \"INFRA-HIGH\", and the \"INFRA-LOW\" field is blank.\r\n\r\nThe \"SHAPE_LENGTH\" field identifies the length of the segment, which is measured in centreline metres. \r\n\r\nBikeways installed prior to 2001 are shown with an install year of 2001.\r\n\r\n",

TTC buses provided transport from Union and Spadina stations to warming centres and shelters, and offered a temporary respite at Spadina Station when space was unavailable.\n\nThe initiative mobilized dedicated buses to provide transportation to warming centres and shelters, as well as provide a temporary warming location while individuals are awaiting transport.\n\nThe transport buses operated from the evening of November 15,2023 to the morning of April 15, 2024, between 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. to provide transport. Individuals sheltering within the transit network were encouraged to move to Spadina Station, where social support services and buses were available. When transport was not needed because shelters and warming centres were at capacity, buses remained stationary at Spadina Station. Access to temporary portable washroom facilities was available at Spadina Station in a well-lit and easy-to-access area.\n\nMore information on the initiative is available here: [TTC Staff Report](https://cdn.ttc.ca/-/media/Project/TTC/DevProto/Documents/Home/Public-Meetings/Board/2024/July-17/4_Update_on_TTCs_Partnership_Approach_to_Community_Safety_Security_and_Well-being_on_Public_Transit.pdf?rev=ff52185741994f3e9eb7a6341ea610ec&hash=1EEED79DAE49CDDB22E7BC7571BE2A2E).",

      "description": "The legacy Section 37 density bonusing framework in the  Planning Act, 1990 enabled the City to negotiate contributions towards local community benefits for development applications that exceeded a site’s zoned height and density. Toronto’s Official Plan provided that Section 37 may be used for development, excepting non-profit developments, with more than 10,000 square metres of gross floor area where the zoning by-law amendment increases the permitted density by at least 1,500 square metres and/or significantly increases the permitted height.\r\n\r\nWhen a developer submitted an application requesting more height and density than allowed, City Planning staff initiated a review process. Section 37 benefits were negotiated on a case-by-case basis with developers, incorporating consultation with the Ward Councillor, the community, and various City Divisions and Agencies. \r\n\r\nIn-kind contributions occur where a development applicant agrees to directly provide the negotiated benefit, such as dedicating physical space within a building for use by non-profit groups. Alternatively, a development applicant can provide cash-in-lieu of the negotiated benefit, transferring responsibility for implementation to the City.\r\n\r\nAfter approval by City Council, the proposed Section 37 benefits are considered to be “secured”, and the developer has a legal obligation to provide the benefits at a future date, usually when applying for a building permit.\r\n\r\nSimilar to Section 37, community benefits can also be obtained pursuant to Section 45(9) of the Planning Act, 1990, where the Committee of Adjustment adds a condition on the approval of a minor variance to the zoning by-law. \r\n\r\n**Note:** There is often a lag between when the City secures and receives a benefit as, in some cases, it can take years before an approved development submits an application for a building permit. Delays in receiving the benefit can also occur when large investments require the pooling of funds from multiple projects. \r\n\r\nTo access the full dataset, use the “Download Data” section to download a CSV, JSON, or XML file.\r\n",

The data used to produce these summary data comes from two sources: a) information about enforcement actions, such as calls for service types and occurrence categories, come from the Service's Records Management System and b) information related to reported use of force, such as highest types of force and perceived weapons, comes from the provincial use of force reports. \r\n\r\nThe data counts unique occurrences which resulted in a police enforcement action or incidents of reported use of force. Hence, there may be more than one person and more than one officer involved in enforcement action incident or reported use of force incident. Since the summary tables are of incidents, where there was more than one person, descriptors such as perceived race refer to the composition of person(s) involved in the enforcement action incident. For example, if the incident involved more than one person, each perceived to be of a different race or gender group, then the incident is categorized as a “multiple race group.” \r\n\r\nFor the purpose of the race-based data analysis, the data includes all incidents which resulted in a police enforcement action and excludes other police interactions with the public, such as taking victim reports, routine traffic or pedestrian stops, or outreach events. Enforcement actions are occurrences where person(s) involved were arrested resulting in charges (including released at scene) or released without charges; received Provincial Offences Act Part III tickets; summons; cautions; diversions; apprehensions, mental health-related incidents as well as those identified as “subject” or “suspect” in an incident to which an officer attended. \r\n\r\nReported use of force incident are those in which a Toronto Police Service officer used force and are required to submit a report under the Police Services Act, 1990. For the purposes of the race-based data analysis, it excludes reportable incidents in which force was used against animals, team reports, and incidents where an officer unintentionally discharged a Service weapon during training. Each reported use of force incident is counted once, regardless of the number of officers or subjects involved.\r\n",

A strip search refers to a search conducted by a police officer on a person, which includes the removal of some or all clothing and a visual inspection of the body. The dataset also includes indicators of whether a person was booked at a police station within 24 hours following a particular arrest event. Due to issues with the booking template, there may be some records where a person was strip searched, but the data does not indicate a booking (i.e., value = 0); in those cases, the user should presume a booking took place. \r\n\r\nThe location of arrest is aggregated to the Division level and refers to where the arrest took place within Division boundaries. Users should not interpret location as the Division to which the arresting officer was assigned. For some arrests, the location could not be geo-coded or the arrest took place outside of City of Toronto boundaries in other jurisdictions; these are indicated by XX. The age of person arrested and/or strip searched is their age at the time of the arrest, as given to the arresting officer. \r\n",

The hierarchy is based on the quality and comfort of the bikeway type, with routes that are shared with vehicles as the lowest comfort, and the greater the separation / dedicated space, the higher the comfort and classification.\r\n\r\nFor example, on a contra-flow bike lane route with sharrows in the other direction, the highest classified cycling infrastructure type on this street is the contra-flow bike lane, and the lower order infrastructure is the sharrows. If the street has the same type of cycling infrastructure on both sides, then the input is the same for both \"INFRA-LOW\" and \"INFRA-HIGH\".

This information helps to determine the overall risk of Lyme disease in Toronto. Toronto has been engaged in active tick surveillance since 2013.\r\nThe tick surveillance program consists of ticks found by dragging.\r\n\r\nTick dragging is a process of collecting ticks in the environment and is done in the spring and fall when adult ticks are active. Dragging locations are selected based on suitable blacklegged tick habitat or a previous confirmed finding of a blacklegged tick. Blacklegged ticks may still be present in very low numbers at a site where none were found by tick dragging efforts.  Ticks are found in wooded or bushy areas with lots of leaves on the ground or where there are tall grasses. As tick populations are expanding, it is possible that blacklegged ticks could be present outside the areas identified by Toronto Public Health. In addition, ticks can travel or migrate on the bodies of animals such as birds and therefore can be present in an area for a year in very low numbers and then disappear. The ticks are sent to the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg for confirmation of species and testing of adults and nymphs for Borrelia burgdorferi.\r\n",

Pednet is integrated with centerline intersections, traffic signals, pedestrian crosswalks and crossovers, traffic signal data from Transportation Services as well as other City of Toronto datasets.\r\n\r\nPednet was built using a variety of open source libraries such as NetworkX, Pandana, Quantum GIS, and Space syntax, as well as production mapping tools from ESRI’s ArcPro/ArcMap. The project source code can be found on DAV’s GitHub account here, which includes the semi-automated offsetting method from the Sidewalk Inventory and the analytical procedures undertaken.\r\n\r\nPednet is a data model resembling a network graph (edges and nodes) weighted by linear distance. Shortest routes were calculated from every building centroid in the city to the nearest nth amenity at the maximum distance of 5000m. Walk times were calculated in the nearest minutes, using the prescribed 1.0m/per-second velocity used by Transportation services. Two separate versions of pednet were created in this iteration of the project: \r\n\r\n1) using actual linear distances as network weights, and \r\n\r\n2) where crosswalks were “extended” by 20% of their length to impose additional impedance to their distances and walk times. \r\n\r\nFor every address within the City of Toronto, the walk times were calculated to various amenities like schools, libraries, hospitals, supermarkets, TTC stops and convenience stores see Section 3. Walk times were assigned to individual addresses as attributes. We then aggregated all these walk times to the census tract level and calculated the minimum, maximum, standard deviation, median, and average walk times. We used these aggregated values to both: \r\n\r\n1) relate walkability measures to Statistics Canada Census data for socio-demographic analysis, as well as \r\n\r\n2) the building footprints, pednet centerlines, and census tract area boundaries to be used in choropleth maps contained within the following sections.",

City of Toronto Neighbourhood Profiles use this Census data to provide a portrait of the demographic, social and economic characteristics of the people and households in each City of Toronto neighbourhood. The profiles present selected highlights from the data, but these accompanying data files provide the full data set assembled for each neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nFor an interactive visualization of this data, visit the [Neighbourhood Profiles webpage](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/neighbourhoods-communities/neighbourhood-profiles/).\r\n\r\nIn these profiles, \"neighbourhood\" refers to the City of Toronto's 158 social planning neighbourhoods. These social planning neighbourhoods were developed in the late 1990s by the City of Toronto to help government and community organizations with local planning by providing socio-economic data at a meaningful geographic area. The boundaries of these social planning neighbourhoods are consistent over time, allowing for comparison between Census years. Neighbourhood level indicators from sources other than the Census of Population are also available through the City's [Wellbeing Toronto](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/neighbourhoods-communities/wellbeing-toronto/) mapping application and here on the Open Data portal.\r\n\r\nEach data point in this file is presented for the City's 158 neighbourhoods or 140 neighbourhoods prior to April 2021. The data is sourced from a number of Census tables released by Statistics Canada. The general Census Profile is the main source table for this data. Data tables are available for the Census years of 2001, 2006, 2011, 2016, and 2021.   \r\n\r\nFor definitions of terms and concepts referenced in this data set, as well as limitations imposed by rounding, data suppression standards, and geometry, users should consult the reference materials produced by Statistics Canada for the [2016 Census](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/ref/index-eng.cfm) or the [2021 Census](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/ref/index-eng.cfm).

As case and outbreak management guidelines changed and COVID-19 specific resources were no longer funded, the level of detail available for cases decreased, and more recent data are less complete and not comparable to previous years. TPH discontinued the production of this report with the final refresh as of February 14, 2024\r\n\r\nAs of February 2023, the fields \"currently hospitalized\", \"currently in ICU\" and \"currently intubated\" have been removed from the Open Data set. Due to current provincial guidelines on COVID-19 case management, discharge information is not always available. This makes it difficult to report accurately on these fields.  The time period for the inaccuracy is not known therefore data in these fields from previous downloads of the open data set should be interpreted with caution.\r\n\r\nAs of July 1, 2023, data entry practices will change to align with updated provincial guidance. TPH will no longer be entering: cases received only by fax and non-severe (not hospitalized or fatal) probable cases associated with outbreaks. This will likely result in an undercount when compared to previous COVID-19 case reporting.\r\n\r\nAs of November 27, 2023, deaths and hospitalization due to COVID are not being entered into CCM due to operational limitations.",
