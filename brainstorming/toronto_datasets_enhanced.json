      "description": "The City of Toronto's Transportation Services Division collects short-term traffic count data across the City on an ad-hoc basis to support a variety of safety initiatives and projects.\r\n\r\nThe data available in this repository are a full collection of Speed, Volume and Classification Counts conducted across the City since 1993.\r\n\r\nThe two most common types of short-term traffic counts are Turning Movement Counts and Speed / Volume / Classification Counts.\r\n\r\n*[Turning Movement Count data, comprised of motor vehicle, bicycle and pedestrian movements through intersections, can be found here](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/traffic-volumes-at-intersections-for-all-modes/).*\r\n\r\nSpeed / Volume / Classification Counts are collected using pneumatic rubber tubes installed across the roadway.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is a critical input into transportation safety initiatives, infrastructure design and program design such as speed limit changes, signal coordination studies, traffic calming and complete street designs.\r\n\r\nEach Speed / Volume / Classification Count is comprised of motor vehicle count data collected over a continuous 24-hour to 168-hour period (1-7 days), at a single location. A handful of non-standard 2-week counts are also included. Some key notes about these counts include:\r\n\r\n- Not all counts have complete speed and classification data. These data are provided for locations and dates only where they exist.\r\n- Raw data are recorded in 15-minute intervals.\r\n- Raw data are recorded separately for each direction of traffic movement. Some data are only available for one direction, even if the street is two-way.\r\n- Within each 15 minute interval, speed data are aggregated into approximately 5 km/h increments.\r\n- Within each 15 minute interval, classification data are aggregated into vehicle type bins by the number of axles, according to the FHWA classification system attached below.\r\n\r\nThe following files showing different views of the data are available:\r\n\r\n- **Data Dictionary (*svc\\_data\\_dictionary.xlsx*)**: Provides a detailed definition of every data field in all files.\r\n- **Summary Data (*svc\\_summary\\_data*)**: Provides metadata about every Speed / Volume / Classification Count available, including information about the count location and count date, as well as summary data about each count (total vehicle volumes, average daily volumes, a.m. and p.m. peak hour volumes, average / 85 percentile / 95 percentile speeds, where available, and heavy vehicle percentage, where available).\r\n- **Most Recent Count Data (*svc\\_most\\_recent\\_summary\\_data*):** Provides metadata about the most recent Speed / Volume / Classification Count data available at each location for which a count exists, including information about the count location and count date, as well as the summary data provided in the “Summary Data” file (see above).\r\n-   **Raw Data:** Raw data is available in 15-minute intervals, and is distributed into one of three different file types based on the count type: volume-only, speed and volume, or classification and volume.\r\n    \r\n    -   If you’re looking for 15-minute data for a specific count, identify the count type and count date, then download the raw data file associated with the count type and period.\r\n        \r\n    -   If you’re looking for volume data for all count types, you will need to download and aggregate all three file types for a given period.\r\n        \r\n    -   **Volume Raw Data (**_**svc\\_raw\\_data\\_volume\\_yyyy\\_yyyy**_**):** These files—grouped by 5-10 year interval—provide volume data in 15-minute intervals, for each direction separately. You will find the raw data for volume-only counts (ATR_VOLUME) here.\r\n        \r\n    -   **Speed and Volume Raw Data (**_**svc\\_raw\\_data\\_speed\\_yyyy\\_yyyy**_**):** These files—grouped by 5-10 year interval—provide volume data aggregated into speed bins in approximately 5 km/h increments. Speed data are not available for all counts. You will find the raw data for speed and volume counts (ATR\\_SPEED\\_VOLUME) here.\r\n        \r\n    -   **Classification and Volume Raw Data (**_**svc\\_raw\\_data\\_classification\\_yyyy\\_yyyy**_**):** These files—grouped by 5-10 year interval—provide volume data aggregated into vehicle type bins by the number of axles, according to the FHWA classification system. Classification data are not available for all counts. You will find the raw data for classification and volume counts (VEHICLE_CLASS) here.\r\n\r\n\r\n- **FHWA Classification Reference (*fhwa\\_classification.png*):** Provides a reference for the FHWA classification system.\r\n\r\nThis dataset references the [City of Toronto's Street Centreline](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/toronto-centreline-tcl/) dataset, [Intersection File dataset](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/intersection-file-city-of-toronto/) and [Street Traffic Signal dataset](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/traffic-signals-tabular/).",

The data provides daily updated information about shelter and overnight service programs administered by TSSS including the program's operator, location, classification, occupancy and capacity.\r\nThis reporting revises and updates the approach taken in the [Daily Shelter Occupancy data set] (https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/daily-shelter-occupancy/), starting with the current year data for 2021. This new data set includes the following revisions:\r\n\r\n* __Overnight service type:__ The previous data set only reported on shelter programs, now all overnight service types where occupancy is tracked in SMIS are included.\r\n\r\n* __Capacity type:__ Programs are categorized in this data set as having either bed based or room based capacity. Bed based capacity is typically applicable for programs with common sleeping areas, while room based capacity is typically applicable for family programs and hotel programs where sleeping rooms are not shared by people from different households. This change prevents over reporting of capacity in room based programs.\r\n\r\n* __Two measures of capacity:__ This data set provides information about two measures of capacity. __Funding__ capacity reports the number of beds or rooms that a program is intended to provide. This is also the capacity measure provided in the previous Daily Shelter Occupancy data set. There are a number of reasons why beds or rooms may be temporarily out of service, including maintenance, repairs, renovations, outbreaks or pest control, so a second capacity measure is also included in the reporting. __Actual__ capacity reports the number of beds or rooms in service and showing as available for occupancy in the Shelter Management Information System at time of reporting. The previous data set reported only funding capacity, but actual capacity is a more effective capacity measure to assess program occupancy rates.\r\n\r\n### Definitions\r\nDefinitions for each field in the data set are provided under data features. Additional definitions about housing & homelessness services can be found in the Housing & Homelessness Services Glossary, which you can find on the [Housing Stability Service System Overview](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/research-reports/housing-and-homelessness-research-and-reports/housing-stability-service-system-map-and-terms/) web page.\r\n",

The bylaw applies to new commercial, institutional and many\r\nresidential development applications and to certain developments not completed\r\nbefore the bylaw came into effect on Jan 31, 2010\r\n\r\nThe Eco-Roof Incentive Program provides incentives to support the installation of green roofs and cool roofs on Toronto homes and buildings. Known collectively as eco-roofs, these technologies along with other City strategies help to make Toronto more resilient and better adapted to climate change. To learn more and access funding to support your project please visit [Eco-Roof Incentive Program](https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/water-environment/environmental-grants-incentives/green-your-roof/).\r\n\r\nData for Eco-Roof Incentive Program are updated quarterly while all green roofs are updated weekly.

During evaluations, Bylaw Enforcement Officers inspect common areas, mechanical and security systems, parking and exterior grounds.\r\n\r\nIn 2023, RentsafeTO updated its evaluation process. Buildings must undergo evaluation at least once every two years, increasing the number of evaluation categories to 50 and allocating a weight to the category.\r\n\r\nEach category item is inspected and assigned a score from one to three with one being the lowest and three being the highest. At times, an item may be assigned a score of 0 if it cannot be evaluated due to an obstruction or refusal to inspect. Additionally, if an item is not applicable to the building at the time of evaluation, the score will show as blank in the dataset.\r\n\r\nTo download data from building evaluations before 2023, please download “Pre-2023 Apartment Building Evaluations\" and “Apartment Building Evaluations 2023 - current” to download data from building evaluations from 2023 and beyond.\r\n\r\nLearn more about [RentSafeTO: Evaluation Tool – City of Toronto](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/housing-shelter/rental-housing-tenant-information/rental-housing-standards/apartment-building-standards/rentsafeto-evaluation-tool/).",

      "description": "The City of Toronto's Transportation Services Division collects short-term traffic count data across the City on an ad-hoc basis to support a variety of safety initiatives and projects.\r\n\r\nThe data available in this repository are a full collection of Turning Movement Counts (TMC) conducted across the City since 1984.\r\n\r\nThe two most common types of short-term traffic counts are Turning Movement Counts and Speed / Volume / Classification Counts.\r\n\r\n*[Speed / Volume / Classification Count data, comprised of vehicle speeds and volumes broken down by vehicle type, can be found here](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/traffic-volumes-midblock-vehicle-speed-volume-and-classification-counts/).*\r\n\r\nTurning Movement Counts include the movements of motor vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians through intersections. Counts are captured using video technology. Older counts were conducted manually by field staff.\r\n\r\nThe City of Toronto uses this data to inform signal timing and infrastructure design.\r\n\r\nEach Turning Movement Count is comprised of data collected over 8 non-continuous hours (before September 2023) or over a continuous 14-hour period (September 2023 and after), at a single location. Some key notes about these counts include:\r\n\r\n- Motor vehicle volumes are available for movements through the intersection (left-turn, right-turn and through-movement for each leg of the intersection).\r\n- Motor vehicle volumes are further broken down by vehicle type (car, truck, bus).\r\n- Total bicycle volumes approaching the intersection from each direction are available.\r\n- Total pedestrian volumes crossing each leg of the intersection are available.\r\n- Raw data are recorded and aggregated into 15-minute intervals.\r\n\r\nThe following files showing different views of the data are available:\r\n\r\n- **Summary Data (*tmc\\_summary\\_data*)**: Provides metadata about every TMC available, including information about the count location and count date, as well as summary data about each count (total 8- or 14-hour pedestrian volumes, total 8- or 14-hour vehicle and bicycle volumes for each approach to the intersection, percent of total that are heavy vehicles and a.m. and p.m. peak hour vehicle and bicycle volumes).\r\n- **Most Recent Count Data (*tmc\\_most\\_recent\\_summary\\_data*)**: Provides metadata about the most recent TMC available at each location for which a TMC exists, including information about the count location and count date, as well as the summary data provided in the “Summary Data” file (see above).\r\n- **Raw Data (*tmc\\_raw\\_data\\_yyyy\\_yyyy*)**: These files—grouped by 5-10 year interval—provide count volumes for cars, trucks, buses, cyclists and pedestrians in 15-minute intervals, for movements through the intersection, for every TMC available. Vehicle volumes are broken down by movement through the intersection (left-turn, right-turn and through-movement, for each approach), cyclist volumes are broken down by leg they enter the intersection and pedestrian volumes are broken down by the leg of the intersection they are counted crossing.\r\n\r\nData dictionaries can be found under each of the views below.\r\n\r\nThis dataset references the City of [Toronto's Street Centreline](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/toronto-centreline-tcl/) dataset, [Intersection File dataset](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/intersection-file-city-of-toronto/) and [Street Traffic Signal dataset](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/traffic-signals-tabular/).",

A short-term rental is all or part of a dwelling unit rented out for less than 28 consecutive days in exchange for payment. This includes bed and breakfasts (B&Bs) but excludes hotels and motels. It also excludes other accommodations where there is no payment.\r\n\r\nShort-term rental operators are people renting their homes or rooms on a short-term basis, for a period of less than 28 consecutive days. These operators need to register with the City in order to operate in Toronto.\r\nThis dataset contains all short-term rental active registration numbers issued from the City of Toronto, address, unit, first 3 digits of the postal code, property type, ward number and, ward name. This information was collected from the registration process and the issuance of an approved short-term rental operator registration number. \r\n\r\nThe information will be used by short-term rental companies to enhance the operator verification process and ensure that all listings have valid registration numbers, as well as improve transparency in the program. This information is updated on a daily basis.\r\n",

Generally, the camera is triggered when a vehicle enters the intersection (passes the stop-bar) after the traffic signal has turned red. The camera will take two time-stamped photographs of the vehicle: one is taken as the vehicle approaches the stop line and the second is taken as the vehicle moves through the intersection. RLC is focused on altering driver behaviour to eliminate red-light running and increase safety for all road users. \r\n\r\nThis dataset identifies the intersections in Toronto where Red Light Cameras are located.\r\n\r\nFor a list of historical (including de-commissioned) locations, please visit the Red Light Camera website or contact us at the email listed.\r\n\r\n",

Bundling with state-of-good repair projects is the most cost-efficient and least disruptive time to add a sidewalk and is in keeping with Council direction as part of the Vision Zero 2.0 Road Safety Plan Update. This allows for more flexibility in sidewalk design in order minimize impacts such as tree removals and associated cost savings by bundling capital projects.\n\nAll new sidewalk projects undergo consultation with residents and property owners and are reported annually to the Infrastructure & Environment Committee with recommendations to City Council.\n\nFor more information about the program, visit [Sidewalks in Toronto](https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/streets-parking-transportation/sidewalk-tours-wayfinding/sidewalks-in-toronto).",

Whether public is looking for swimming, fitness, skating, skiing, arts and crafts or dance Parks, Forestry, and Recreation Division of the City of Toronto has something for everyone.\n\nInformation presented in this dataset is used as data source for [Parks, Forestry, and Recreation website](https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/venues-facilities-bookings/booking-park-recreation-facilities/parks-and-recreation-facilities/). For examples of registered and drop-in recreation programs at particular locations please refer to: [Examples.](https://www.toronto.ca/data/parks/prd/facilities/complex/85/index.html)\n\n**Dataset contains 4 tabs:**\n\n  1. **Registered Programs**. Each row of the spreadsheet describes a course of a registered program. Course_ID is unique identifier. Recreational programs fall under various categories. A registered program course runs under an activity, on schedule, and has boundaries in regards age of a registrant. You can get information on course location from Locations tab by LocationID. There are multiple courses running at one location.\n  2. **Drop-in**. Each row of the spreadsheet describes a drop-in course. Drop-In Course is a program offered within PFR facilities where registration is not required. Drop-In Participation is an informal involvement in a program where space may permit in an activity, and allow for a pay as you go option (e.g. fitness class, Aquafit class). A drop-in course runs under a category, on schedule, and has boundaries in regards age of registrants. You can get information on course location from Locations tab by LocationID. There are multiple courses running at one location.\n  3. **Locations**. Each row of the spreadsheet describes a location. LocationID is unique identifier. A location has a name, is characterized by a type (park, rec centre), address, and short description, may be fully or partially accessible, and may have a parent location.\n  4. **Facilities**. Each row of the spreadsheet describes a facility. FacilityID is unique identifier. Facility is described by a Type (Display Name) and has multiple assets. 'Facility Rating' column contains values of facility rates (used to learn about amenities that might be available at each facility  - see metadata). Facilities of some types can be permitted - 'Permit' column contains information on necessary permit. You can get information on facility's location from Locations tab by LocationID. Every location has multiple facilities.\n\n\n\n  \nThe source of the data is Parks, Forestry & Recreation SQL Server database that combines information from the City of Toronto Recreation Management System and Parks, Forestry & Recreation Asset Management System. The dataset updates are scheduled daily **at 8:00 AM.**\n\n**Comments:  \n** The file contains data on recreation programs presented in the City of Toronto Parks, Forestry, and Recreation web site. The information in data repositories that are sources for the website is updated on daily and reflects situation as of **1 day** prior to dataset update. Changes might not be reflected right away in the dataset due to processing lags. Examples of such are program cancellations, community centres closures, locations change, etc. In cases where data changes require additional time for implementation this gap may exceed 24 hours. The Parks, Forestry, and Recreation Division makes every effort to keep this Open Data set updated and accurate.",

These replacements happen after damage has occurred on curbs and sidewalks; it is not necessarily the recreation of an entire sidewalk but rather they are state of good repair replacements. ",

Green Spaces includes public parks, beaches, parts of ravines, golf courses, cemeteries, and other open space areas such as those offered by various private institutions. These spaces may or may not be publicly accessible and are either publicly owned/maintained or they are privately owned/maintained. Green Spaces is not an exhaustive dataset of all the public and private parks and open spaces within the City. It does not encompass all areas protected by the Ravine and Natural Feature Protection By-Law, by Environmentally Significant Areas or by Natural Heritage Areas.  \r\n\r\nGreen Spaces is primarily intended to visualize our existing overall parks and open space system. It is used to symbolize the green coloured areas in many of the City's mapping products such as Toronto's Interactive Map or the Toronto Parkland Strategy[^1]. \r\n\r\nThis dataset is jointly maintained by the Geospatial Competency Centre (GCC) and the Parks, Forestry & Recreation division (PFR). The attribute field in this dataset titled \"AREA_CLASS\" indicates whether the GCC or PFR maintain the data and the type of green space it is.\r\n\r\n**PFR Green Spaces**  \r\n\r\nPFR Green Spaces are owned and/or operated by the City of Toronto and are derived from PFR's Parkland Asset Repository. They include the area classes: Park, Golf Course, Cemetery, Hydro Field/Utility Corridor, and others. Representation of Green Spaces can change overtime – due to new park acquisitions, development/reconfiguration of land etc. – PFR works to continuously improve the City-PFR-owned portions of this dataset as new information arises. \r\n\r\n**GCC Green Spaces**  \r\n\r\nAll other Green Spaces were created by the GCC and include area classes with the prefix of \"OTHER_\". These green spaces are derived through city-wide parcel analysis.\r\n\r\n[^1]This Green Spaces layer cannot be used to reproduce the results of the [2019 Parkland Strategy](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/accountability-operations-customer-service/long-term-vision-plans-and-strategies/parkland-strategy/), however the GCC Green Spaces portions of the dataset was used to help visualize Other Open Spaces in \"Figure 06: Toronto’s Parks and Open Space Network\" of the report. The Toronto Parkland Strategy is currently in the process of being updated and new parkland data is not yet finalized.\r\n",

      "description": "Effective March 1, 2019, the [Municipal Conflict of Interest Act](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90m50), requires municipalities to make a registry of declarations of interest available for public inspection. These open data sets allow you to review the record of declared interests for Members of Council.  \r\n\r\n\r\nVerbal declarations are recorded and published as part of the minutes of each meeting. Changes to the Municipal Conflict of Interest Act now require Members to submit a written declaration in addition to making a verbal declaration. Both are captured in this registry as of March 1, 2019. Records prior to March 1, 2019 contain only verbal declarations and the Act does not require retroactive written declarations.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Description of the data**\r\n\r\nThe declaration data for an item becomes available when the minutes for a meeting have been published.\r\n\r\n- **Committee**: The name of the committee, board or Council where the item was considered and the declaration was made\r\n\r\n- **First Name**: First name of Member\r\n\r\n- **Last Name**: Last name of Member  \r\n\r\n- **Item**: The agenda item number as a hyperlink\r\n\r\n- **Item Title**: The agenda item title\r\n\r\n- **Receive Date**: The receive date is the date the written declaration was received by the Clerk.\r\n\r\n- **Verbal Declaration**: The verbal declaration as recorded by the Clerk or board secretary\r\n\r\n- **Verbal Declaration Date**: The date that the Member made the verbal declaration\r\n\r\n\r\nWritten declarations are links to a PDF copy of the original written document presented to the Clerk. If you require assistance with these documents, please contact the appropriate Committee or Council team.\r\nMembers listed also include public Members appointed to Boards by City Council.\r\n",

The overnight services, including emergency shelters, respites, and other allied services (including hotel/motel programs and warming centres), use the Shelter Management Information System (SMIS) to intake people who are accessing these services into their programs.\r\n\r\nThe Shelter System Flow data shares information about people experiencing homelessness who are entering and leaving the shelter system each month, including the number of unique people who have used the shelter system at least one time in the past three months and are considered to be actively experiencing homelessness (ie; they were not discharged to permanent housing). \r\n\r\nThis information provides insight into who is experiencing homelessness and how the City's system is functioning. It will also help measure progress towards the vision of reducing homelessness in Toronto to rare, brief, and non-recurring instances. \r\n\r\nOver time, the data will be expanded to capture more people, such as people sleeping outdoors and people using overnight homelessness services that are not funded by the City of Toronto to provide more comprehensive picture of all people experiencing homelessness in Toronto. Based on the most recent Street Needs Assessment, we anticipate that approximately 18 per cent of people experiencing homelessness in Toronto are not currently reflected in this data. \r\n",

      "description": "If you are in need of emergency shelter space, please call the City of Toronto’s Central Intake line at 416-338-4766 or 1-877-338-3398.\r\n\r\nThis catalogue entry provides two data sets related to calls to Central Intake. \r\n\r\nCentral Intake is a City-operated, 24/7 telephone-based service that offers referrals to emergency shelter and other overnight accommodation, as well as information about other homelessness services. These two data sets provide information about calls received by Central Intake, the outcomes of those calls, and the number of individuals who could not be matched to a shelter space each day.\r\n\r\nThe first, **Central Intake Service Queue Data**, provides counts of the number of unique individuals who contacted Central Intake to access emergency shelter but were not matched to a shelter space. Generated through Central Intake caseworkers' use of the City's Shelter Management Information System (SMIS), the data are reported as a count for every operational day.\r\n\r\nThe SMIS service queue for Central Intake records when a bed is requested for a caller seeking a shelter space. Those callers who could not be matched to an available space that suits their needs at the time of their call remain in the queue until they can be provided a referral or until the closeout process at the end of the night (i.e. 4:00 a.m.).\r\n\r\nService Queue data combines data exported from the Central Intake service queue at 4:00 a.m., with manually coded outcome data based on the review of each individual's SMIS records for the day. SSHA began collecting data on how many people remain unmatched in the service queue over a 24 hour period at the beginning of November 2020. Given the manual nature of the preparation of the data in this data set, this file will be updated on a monthly basis. Data will be reported separately for every operational day in that month.\r\n\r\nThe second data set, **Central Intake Call Wrap-Up Codes Data**, provides counts of calls answered by Central Intake, classified by the nature of the call.  When a call is handled by a caseworker at Central Intake, the caseworker assigns a wrap-up code to the call. This tracking allows for analysis of call trends.\r\n\r\nCentral Intake uses 13 distinct wrap-up codes to code the calls they receive. This data set provides a daily summary of the number of calls received by each call wrap-up code. The data are manually retrieved from the City's call centre database reports. Given the manual nature of the preparation of the data in this data set, this file will be updated on a monthly basis. Data will be reported separately for every operational day in that month.\r\n\r\nPlease note that while the wrap-up codes provide information related to the volume and type of calls answered by Central Intake, the data do not track requests made by unique individuals nor the ultimate outcomes of referrals.\r\n\r\nPlease also note that the previews and Data Features below only show information pertaining to the Central Intake Call Wrap-Up Codes Data dataset.\r\n",

It is implemented in accordance with the requirements of the Ministry of Health Beach Management Protocol (January 01, 1998) in order to reduce the incidence of water-borne illness in the population.\r\n\r\nEvery year between June and September (Labour Day), the City of Toronto’s Parks, Forestry & Recreation division collects daily water samples from Toronto’s supervised public beaches to be tested for E.coli bacteria.\r\n\r\nToronto Public Health (TPH) measures E.coli levels to determine the beach water quality (and lifeguards monitor the safety conditions) for public swimming. When E.coli levels are unsafe, TPH posts warning signs against swimming.\r\n\r\nSwimming is not recommended during and after storms, floods, or heavy rainfall. Cloudy water can be an indicator of high levels of bacteria that may pose a risk to human health. Conditions are based upon E. coli counts in beach water samples taken over the past 24 hours.\r\n",

The radar measures the speeds of oncoming vehicles and the LED sign displays their speeds to the passing motorists, thereby reminding them to check their speeds and to obey speed limits. The City’s permanent units are installed in Safety Zones. This dataset contains the locations and operating parameters for installed signs.

By clicking a bridge or structure location on the map, you are able to obtain information about the bridge or structure including the location, usage, age, year of last inspection, inspection results and next inspection year of the bridge or structure. Bridges or structures that are not identified on the map are likely managed by other parties than the ones listed above.\r\n\r\nThe dataset also includes locations of some privately managed bridges, Canadian National Railway (CNR) bridges and Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) bridges. MTO, TTC, MX, CNR, CPR and private owners follow their own inspection routines to maintain their bridges in a state of good repair.

The City of Toronto is provided with this information to determine the property tax rates for residential buildings.\r\n\r\nReasons for Notices Not Mailed:\r\n\r\n(i) Property taxes from one year to the next either increased or did not change (i.e., 2023 to 2024).\r\n\r\n(ii) Property taxes from one year to the next were reduced by less than 2.5%. No notices will be sent from the City. Tenants cannot automatically reduce their rent and must apply to the Landlord and Tenant Board for the rent reduction.\r\n\r\n(iii)   No notice is required if a property is exempt from the rent reduction provisions of the Residential Tenancies Act (s.131)",

      "description": "Ontario’s Immunization of School Pupils Act (ISPA) requires that students who attend elementary and secondary school be vaccinated against nine designated diseases or have a valid medical, religious or conscience exemption provided to their local public health unit to avoid suspension from school. This includes vaccinations for measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, tetanus, polio, pertussis (whooping cough), meningococcal and varicella (chicken pox). As a result, each year Toronto Public Health staff work with schools located in the City of Toronto to assess student immunization records to ensure that all students are a) up-to-date with their required immunization and/or b) a valid exemption for philosophical or medical reasons is provided, in accordance with the ISPA. Toronto Public Health also offers hepatitis B, human papillomavirus (HPV) and meningococcal vaccines to grade 7 and 8 students at school clinics through the School Immunization Program (SIP).\r\n\r\nThis data represents Immunization Coverage Rates and exemptions for School pupils (7-17 year olds) in Toronto for the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 school years. For the 2023/2024 school year, this data represents the immunization coverage rates and exemptions for ISPA vaccines for school pupils in grade 2 and grade 12 and the immunization coverage rates for SIP vaccines for school pupils in grade 8 and grades 10-12. For the 2024/2025 school year, this data represents the immunization coverage rates and exemptions for ISPA vaccine for school pupils in grade 3 and grade 11 and the immunization coverage rates for SIP vaccines for school pupils in grade 8 and grades 9-12. \r\n\r\nFor more info, please [visit here](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/research-reports/public-health-significant-reports/toronto-schools-immunization-coverage-rates/).",

For occurrences prior to this date, coordinates are limited, therefore for some events with NULL coordinates the neighbourhood will be identified as ‘NSA’ to indicate ‘Not Specified Area.’\r\n\r\nThe downloadable datasets display the OCC_DATE fields in UTC timezone.\r\n\r\n### Shooting Event/Occurrence\r\nAny incident in which a projectile is discharged from a firearm (as defined under the Criminal Code of Canada) and injures a person. This excludes firearm discharges, suicide, and police involved firearm discharges.\r\n\r\n### Firearm Discharge\r\nAny incident where evidence exists that a projectile was discharged from a firearm (as defined under the Criminal Code of Canada) including accidental discharge (non-police), celebratory fire, drive-by etc. Events categorized as firearm discharges do not include any events where a person’s injuries were sustained from a bullet(s).\r\n\r\n### Persons Injured (previously classified as “victims”):\r\nA person who was struck by a bullet(s) as a result of the discharge of a firearm (as defined under the Criminal Code of Canada). This excludes events such as suicide, police-involved event or where the weapon used was not a real firearm (such as pellet gun, air pistol, “sim-munition” etc.).\r\n\r\n#### Injury Levels – Death\r\nWhere the injured person (as defined above) has died as a result of injuries sustained from a bullet(s). These events are counted as shootings.\r\n\r\n#### Injury Levels – Injuries\r\nWhere the injured person (as defined above) has non-fatal physical injuries as a result of a bullet(s). These events are counted as shootings. \r\n\r\nThe dataset is intended to provide communities with information regarding public safety and awareness. The data supplied to the Toronto Police Service by the reporting parties is preliminary and may not have been fully verified at the time of publishing the dataset.\r\n\r\nThe location of crime occurrences have been deliberately offset to the nearest road intersection node to protect the privacy of parties involved in the occurrence. All location data must be considered as an approximate location of the occurrence and users are advised not to interpret any of these locations as related to a specific address or individual.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Due to the offset of occurrence location, the numbers by Division and Neighbourhood may not reflect the exact count of occurrences reported within these geographies. Therefore, the Toronto Police Service does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, timeliness of the data and it should not be compared to any other source of crime data.\r\n\r\nBy accessing these datasets, the user agrees to full acknowledgement of the [Open Government Licence - Ontario](https://www.ontario.ca/page/open-government-licence-ontario).\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, the Toronto Police Service has taken the necessary measures to protect the privacy of individuals involved in the reported occurrences. No personal information related to any of the parties involved in the occurrence will be released as open data.\r\n",

The term collision indicates that the initial point of contact involved at least one motor vehicle or streetcar.\r\n\r\n### Definitions:\r\n**Fatal Collisions** occur when an individual’s injuries from a MVC result in a fatality within 30 days. Please note this category excludes:\r\n(i)   Occurrences on private property\r\n(ii)  Occurrences related to sudden death prior to collision (suicide or medical episode)\r\n(iii) Occurrences where the individual has died more than 30 days after the collision\r\n\r\n**Personal Injury Collisions** occur when an individual involved in a MVC suffers personal injuries. \r\n\r\n**Fail to Remain Collisions** occur when an individual involved in a MVC fails to stop and provide their information at the scene of a collision.\r\n\r\n**Property Damage Collisions** occur when an individual’s property has been damaged in a MVC or the value of damages is less than $2,000 for all involved parties.\r\n\r\nThis data does not include occurrences that have been deemed unfounded. The definition of unfounded according to Statistics Canada is: “It has been determined through police investigation that the offence reported did not occur, nor was it attempted” (Statistics Canada, 2020).**\r\n\r\n** Statistics Canada. 2020.

The definition of unfounded according to Statistics Canada is: “It has been determined through police investigation that the offence reported did not occur, nor was it attempted” (Statistics Canada, 2020).**\r\n\r\nThe dataset is intended to provide communities with information regarding public safety and awareness. The data supplied to the Toronto Police Service by the reporting parties is preliminary and may not have been fully verified at the time of publishing the dataset.  \r\n \r\nThe location of crime occurrences have been deliberately offset to the nearest road intersection node to protect the privacy of parties involved in the occurrence. All location data must be considered as an approximate location of the occurrence and users are advised not to interpret any of these locations as related to a specific address or individual.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Due to the offset of occurrence location, the numbers by Division and Neighbourhood may not reflect the exact count of occurrences reported within these geographies. Therefore, the Toronto Police Service does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, timeliness of the data and it should not be compared to any other source of crime data.\r\n\r\nBy accessing these datasets, the user agrees to full acknowledgement of the [Open Government Licence - Ontario](https://www.ontario.ca/page/open-government-licence-ontario).\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, the Toronto Police Service has taken the necessary measures to protect the privacy of individuals involved in the reported occurrences. No personal information related to any of the parties involved in the occurrence will be released as open data.\r\n\r\n ** Statistics Canada. 2020. Uniform Crime Reporting Manual.

Currently 31 out of 140 neighbourhoods are designated as NIAs as part of the Toronto Strong Neighbourhoods 2020 (TSNS2020) project. This dataset superceded the previous 13 Priority Areas in April 2014. For further details please read the technical documentation found in the download package or visit www.toronto.ca/neighbourhoods. For a link to the older 13 Priority Areas used between 2005 and 2013, go here: [Priority Investment Neighbourhoods](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/priority-investment-neighbourhoods)\r\n\r\nDataset is based on Statistics Canada's 2011 Census Tracts, as found in the Census Dictionary and Reference Geography Maps. Area of coverage is the city of Toronto only. Dataset is based on Centreline dataset. This dataset works best with datasets with the same projection.\r\n",

      "description": "This data primarily pertains to City-owned trees located on road allowances across Toronto. The intent of the database is to provide an inventory of City owned-trees on the road allowance for inspection and maintenance. Urban Forestry has had requests to determine ownership of trees within the road allowance, and where this has confirmed private ownership, these trees may be in the database as well for future reference.\r\n\r\nThe dataset is limited to the City of Toronto boundaries and is best utilized when overlaid with the City's Street Centreline file. This shape file should not be used for ownership verification. The positioning shown is not accurate as the tree data has been geographically coded to the parcel address, and this will incorrectly indicate the tree location within the private parcel. The Toronto Street Tree data is compiled by Urban Forestry staff during their inspections or tree maintenance work on trees located on City owned street allowances. The database is large covering over 530,000 records and annually Urban Forestry can only update the volume that is worked on. Some data may be several years old and have not been updated recently, so there may be inaccuracies with the data as a result.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**_Note:_** _We are currently updating and improving street tree location information. This is an ongoing process; therefore, some trees may still appear mapped to the address point, whereas others will be mapped in their physical location along the street. For more information please contact Urban Forestry._\r\n\r\n**_Downloading_** _This is a fairly large data set. If you have any issues (like a timeout) using the dynamic file downloader (the first link in the \"Download Data\" section) feel free to use the **Alternate Files**._\r\n\r\n \r\n",

      "description": "\"Toronto’s 158 neighbourhoods are a microcosm of the city’s inhabitants, cultures and life. The primary purpose of the City-designated social planning neighbourhoods is to help City staff collect data, plan, analyze and forecast City services. While these neighbourhoods may not fully encompass every historical neighbourhood area, they do provide a way for planners and researchers to track information about them over time.\r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood profiles were developed to help government and community agencies with their local planning, by providing socio-economic data at a meaningful geographic area. Unlike other geographies like wards or dissemination blocks, the boundaries of these social planning neighbourhoods change very infrequently over time, allowing researchers to perform longitudinal studies to see the changes in each area. Not all people define neighbourhoods the same way, but for the purposes of statistical reporting these neighbourhoods were defined based on [Statistics Canada census tracts](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/ref/dict/geo013-eng.cfm).\r\n\r\nFor more information visit our [About Toronto's Neighbourhoods](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/neighbourhoods-communities/neighbourhood-profiles/) page.\"\r\n",

      "description": "The Toronto bikeways dataset illustrates the existing cycling network across the city, including both shared and dedicated bikeways. A summary of the network status is available at toronto.ca/cyclingnetwork \r\n\r\nThe Toronto bikeways dataset contains the following types of bikeways: cycle tracks, bicycle lanes (including buffered bike lanes and contra-flow bike lanes), neighbourhood routes with sharrows (including wayfinding sharrows), multi-use trails (including off-road and in-boulevard), as well as signed cycling routes. \r\n\r\nThere are two fields that reference the bikeway type because some streets have different infrastructure on each side of the roadway. \"INFRA-HIGH\" refers to the highest classified cycling infrastructure type installed on this segment. \"INFRA-LOW\" refers to the lowest classified cycling infrastructure type. The hierarchy is based on the quality and comfort of the bikeway type, with routes that are shared with vehicles as the lowest comfort, and the greater the separation / dedicated space, the higher the comfort and classification.\r\n\r\nFor example, on a contra-flow bike lane route with sharrows in the other direction, the highest classified cycling infrastructure type on this street is the contra-flow bike lane, and the lower order infrastructure is the sharrows. If the street has the same type of cycling infrastructure on both sides, then the input is the same for both \"INFRA-LOW\" and \"INFRA-HIGH\". If there is a bikeway on only one side of a street, the bikeway type is listed under \"INFRA-HIGH\", and the \"INFRA-LOW\" field is blank.\r\n\r\nThe \"SHAPE_LENGTH\" field identifies the length of the segment, which is measured in centreline metres. \r\n\r\nBikeways installed prior to 2001 are shown with an install year of 2001.\r\n\r\n",

      "description": "This data set provides daily data about use of the TTC’s Transport Bus Initiative.\n\nThis initiative was implemented from November 2023 to April 2024 in response to the ongoing use of the transit network by persons experiencing homelessness. TTC buses provided transport from Union and Spadina stations to warming centres and shelters, and offered a temporary respite at Spadina Station when space was unavailable.\n\nThe initiative mobilized dedicated buses to provide transportation to warming centres and shelters, as well as provide a temporary warming location while individuals are awaiting transport.\n\nThe transport buses operated from the evening of November 15,2023 to the morning of April 15, 2024, between 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. to provide transport. Individuals sheltering within the transit network were encouraged to move to Spadina Station, where social support services and buses were available. When transport was not needed because shelters and warming centres were at capacity, buses remained stationary at Spadina Station. Access to temporary portable washroom facilities was available at Spadina Station in a well-lit and easy-to-access area.\n\nMore information on the initiative is available here: [TTC Staff Report](https://cdn.ttc.ca/-/media/Project/TTC/DevProto/Documents/Home/Public-Meetings/Board/2024/July-17/4_Update_on_TTCs_Partnership_Approach_to_Community_Safety_Security_and_Well-being_on_Public_Transit.pdf?rev=ff52185741994f3e9eb7a6341ea610ec&hash=1EEED79DAE49CDDB22E7BC7571BE2A2E).",

      "description": "The legacy Section 37 density bonusing framework in the  Planning Act, 1990 enabled the City to negotiate contributions towards local community benefits for development applications that exceeded a site’s zoned height and density. Toronto’s Official Plan provided that Section 37 may be used for development, excepting non-profit developments, with more than 10,000 square metres of gross floor area where the zoning by-law amendment increases the permitted density by at least 1,500 square metres and/or significantly increases the permitted height.\r\n\r\nWhen a developer submitted an application requesting more height and density than allowed, City Planning staff initiated a review process. Section 37 benefits were negotiated on a case-by-case basis with developers, incorporating consultation with the Ward Councillor, the community, and various City Divisions and Agencies. \r\n\r\nIn-kind contributions occur where a development applicant agrees to directly provide the negotiated benefit, such as dedicating physical space within a building for use by non-profit groups. Alternatively, a development applicant can provide cash-in-lieu of the negotiated benefit, transferring responsibility for implementation to the City.\r\n\r\nAfter approval by City Council, the proposed Section 37 benefits are considered to be “secured”, and the developer has a legal obligation to provide the benefits at a future date, usually when applying for a building permit.\r\n\r\nSimilar to Section 37, community benefits can also be obtained pursuant to Section 45(9) of the Planning Act, 1990, where the Committee of Adjustment adds a condition on the approval of a minor variance to the zoning by-law. \r\n\r\n**Note:** There is often a lag between when the City secures and receives a benefit as, in some cases, it can take years before an approved development submits an application for a building permit. Delays in receiving the benefit can also occur when large investments require the pooling of funds from multiple projects. \r\n\r\nTo access the full dataset, use the “Download Data” section to download a CSV, JSON, or XML file.\r\n",

      "description": "This dataset contains summary table data of information from the provincial Use of Force Reports and occurrences that resulted in an enforcement action. The data used to produce these summary data comes from two sources: a) information about enforcement actions, such as calls for service types and occurrence categories, come from the Service's Records Management System and b) information related to reported use of force, such as highest types of force and perceived weapons, comes from the provincial use of force reports. \r\n\r\nThe data counts unique occurrences which resulted in a police enforcement action or incidents of reported use of force. Hence, there may be more than one person and more than one officer involved in enforcement action incident or reported use of force incident. Since the summary tables are of incidents, where there was more than one person, descriptors such as perceived race refer to the composition of person(s) involved in the enforcement action incident. For example, if the incident involved more than one person, each perceived to be of a different race or gender group, then the incident is categorized as a “multiple race group.” \r\n\r\nFor the purpose of the race-based data analysis, the data includes all incidents which resulted in a police enforcement action and excludes other police interactions with the public, such as taking victim reports, routine traffic or pedestrian stops, or outreach events. Enforcement actions are occurrences where person(s) involved were arrested resulting in charges (including released at scene) or released without charges; received Provincial Offences Act Part III tickets; summons; cautions; diversions; apprehensions, mental health-related incidents as well as those identified as “subject” or “suspect” in an incident to which an officer attended. \r\n\r\nReported use of force incident are those in which a Toronto Police Service officer used force and are required to submit a report under the Police Services Act, 1990. For the purposes of the race-based data analysis, it excludes reportable incidents in which force was used against animals, team reports, and incidents where an officer unintentionally discharged a Service weapon during training. Each reported use of force incident is counted once, regardless of the number of officers or subjects involved.\r\n",

Due to issues with the booking template, there may be some records where a person was strip searched, but the data does not indicate a booking (i.e., value = 0); in those cases, the user should presume a booking took place. \r\n\r\nThe location of arrest is aggregated to the Division level and refers to where the arrest took place within Division boundaries. Users should not interpret location as the Division to which the arresting officer was assigned. For some arrests, the location could not be geo-coded or the arrest took place outside of City of Toronto boundaries in other jurisdictions; these are indicated by XX. The age of person arrested and/or strip searched is their age at the time of the arrest, as given to the arresting officer. \r\n",

      "description": "The data in this repository were collected as part of the 2022 Toronto Micromobility Cordon and Classification Count. The dataset contains information on how many cyclists and micromobility users are riding on specific downtown streets, when and where they are riding, and other characteristics such as device type, apparent trip purpose, and whether they are riding in a bicycle lane, in mixed-traffic, or on the sidewalk.\r\n\r\nSeven screenlines that together make up two cordon boundaries were included in the study. The inner cordon is bounded by Bloor Street, Spadina Avenue, Queen's Quay and Jarvis Street. The outer cordon is bounded by Dufferin Street, the CP Rail Corridor (mostly parallel with Dupont Street), the Don River, and Lake Ontario. A few additional count locations not on cordon boundaries were also included to capture key high-volume locations. \r\n\r\nEach cordon was counted on a single day, between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. The Cordon Count was conducted in early fall. Mid-week, good weather days were chosen to best represent typical weekday cycling and micromobility travel patterns.\r\n\r\nThe counts are separated by date, location, and direction of travel. A count summary table, a table of disaggregated counts and classifications, and a classification dictionary table are included. The data are fully anonymous.\r\n\r\nA report on the findings of the 2022 Bicycle and Micromobility Cordon Count is available at [Cycling Data, Events & Programs](https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/streets-parking-transportation/cycling-in-toronto/cycling-events-and-programs).\r\n\r\nPrevious iterations of the study can be found at [Bicycle Cordon Count: 2010, 2013, 2014](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/bicycle-cordon-count-2010-2013-2014).",

Counts are available for Assault, Auto Theft, Break and Enter, Robbery, Theft Over, Homicide and Shooting & Firearm Discharges. Data also includes the crime rate per 100,000 population calculated using the population estimates provided by Environics Analytics.\r\n\r\nFollowing the standard definition by StatsCan, crime rate is calculated as the crime count per 100,000 population* per year. This metric facilitates the comparisons of crime between geographic areas with different size of populations. Comparing to crime count, crime rate provides a fairer comparison of the crime over time by taking into account the change in population in the region.\r\n\r\nNote: Fields have been included for the new 158 City of Toronto Neighbourhoods structure \r\n\r\n*Population figures reflect only the resident population of a region.

This reflects a reliability rate for the scheduled collections of more than 99.9 per cent.\n\nIn 2023, only about 20 per cent of service requests for overflowing or uncollected bins were repeats of the same location and just under 5 per cent were locations that received three or more service requests.\n\nAny overflowing bins should be reported to 311. Solid Waste Management Services addresses any service requests related to overflowing street litter bins within 24 hours. ",

      "description": "The Toronto bikeways dataset illustrates the existing cycling network across the city, including both shared and dedicated bikeways. A summary of the network status is available at toronto.ca/cyclingnetwork \r\n\r\nThe Toronto bikeways dataset contains the following types of bikeways: cycle tracks, bicycle lanes (including buffered bike lanes and contra-flow bike lanes), neighbourhood routes with sharrows (including wayfinding sharrows), multi-use trails (including off-road and in-boulevard), as well as signed cycling routes. \r\n\r\nThere are two fields that reference the bikeway type because some streets have different infrastructure on each side of the roadway. \"INFRA-HIGH\" refers to the highest classified cycling infrastructure type installed on this segment. \"INFRA-LOW\" refers to the lowest classified cycling infrastructure type. The hierarchy is based on the quality and comfort of the bikeway type, with routes that are shared with vehicles as the lowest comfort, and the greater the separation / dedicated space, the higher the comfort and classification.\r\n\r\nFor example, on a contra-flow bike lane route with sharrows in the other direction, the highest classified cycling infrastructure type on this street is the contra-flow bike lane, and the lower order infrastructure is the sharrows. If the street has the same type of cycling infrastructure on both sides, then the input is the same for both \"INFRA-LOW\" and \"INFRA-HIGH\". If there is a bikeway on only one side of a street, the bikeway type is listed under \"INFRA-HIGH\", and the \"INFRA-LOW\" field is blank.\r\n\r\nThe \"SHAPE_LENGTH\" field identifies the length of the segment, which is measured in centreline metres. \r\n\r\nBikeways installed prior to 2001 are shown with an install year of 2001.\r\n\r\n",

      "description": "Toronto’s tick surveillance program monitors the number of blacklegged ticks, their locations and the number of them that carry the bacteria that causes Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi). This information helps to determine the overall risk of Lyme disease in Toronto. Toronto has been engaged in active tick surveillance since 2013.\r\nThe tick surveillance program consists of ticks found by dragging.\r\n\r\nTick dragging is a process of collecting ticks in the environment and is done in the spring and fall when adult ticks are active. Dragging locations are selected based on suitable blacklegged tick habitat or a previous confirmed finding of a blacklegged tick. Blacklegged ticks may still be present in very low numbers at a site where none were found by tick dragging efforts.  Ticks are found in wooded or bushy areas with lots of leaves on the ground or where there are tall grasses. As tick populations are expanding, it is possible that blacklegged ticks could be present outside the areas identified by Toronto Public Health. In addition, ticks can travel or migrate on the bodies of animals such as birds and therefore can be present in an area for a year in very low numbers and then disappear. The ticks are sent to the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg for confirmation of species and testing of adults and nymphs for Borrelia burgdorferi.\r\n",

The dataset provides details on location information, ice rink (i.e. pad) size and lighting conditions.\r\n\r\nThe operational status of an outdoor artificial ice rink is updated in near real-time by staff throughout the day. The most updated information can be found by accessing the JSON file linked below:\r\n\r\n[https://www.toronto.ca/data/parks/live/skate_allupdates.json](https://www.toronto.ca/data/parks/live/skate_allupdates.json)\r\n\r\nOperational Statuses include:\r\n\r\n* 0 = closed\r\n\r\n* 1 = open\r\n\r\n* 2 = service alert\r\n\r\nThe json file and the rink list should be joined by first parsing the numeric digits from the [locations] column in the json, and then joining to the rink file on [locationid]. Note: The json file will only show status information for ice pads that have active service alerts on them.\r\n\r\nThe data provided is sourced from the City of Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation Asset Management System. The dataset has been validated on-site by parks supervisors and through necessary inter-divisional staff.\r\n\r\n**Note**:\r\n\r\nThis dataset only contains information about outdoor artificial ice rinks and skate trails maintained by Parks, Forestry and Recreation Division of the City of Toronto. Natural ice rinks are not included in this dataset and more information can be found on [Toronto.ca/rec](https://www.toronto.ca/explore-enjoy/recreation/).

The most updated information can be found by accessing the JSON file linked below:\r\n\r\n[https://www.toronto.ca/data/parks/live/skate_allupdates.json](https://www.toronto.ca/data/parks/live/skate_allupdates.json)\r\n\r\nOperational Statuses include:\r\n\r\n*\t0 = closed\r\n\r\n*\t1 = open\r\n\r\n*\t2 = service alert\r\n\r\nThe json file and the rink list should be joined by first parsing the numeric digits from the [locations] column in the json, and then joining to the rink file on [locationid]. Note: The json file will only show status information for ice pads that have active service alerts on them.\r\n\r\n**Note:**\r\nThe dataset contains information about indoor ice rinks owned by the City of Toronto and operated by either by the Parks, Forestry, and Recreation Division or another City of Toronto Corporation or Agency. All other indoor ice rinks (either public access, or private) are out of scope of this dataset.\r\n\r\n**Lakeshore Arena Corporation:** \r\nThe Lakeshore Arena Corporation is a City corporation that manages the Lakeshore Arena (operating as the Ford Performance Centre), a marquee four-pad ice arena in the South Etobicoke area of Toronto. The Lakeshore Arena offers ice rentals, leagues, public skating, drop-in programs, tournaments and special events to the local community. \r\n\r\n**Arena Boards:**\r\nEight arenas in Toronto are operated by volunteer Arena Boards of Management (Arena Boards). The board-run arenas provide indoor ice sport facilities and other recreational spaces such as community rooms and banquet halls. Programs offered include hockey and figure skating and leisure skating. Some arenas also offer dry floor rentals (i.e., floor hockey) in the summer. These services are complemented by snack bars, pro-shops, and meeting rooms rentals at some locations.\r\n",

      "description": "The Pedestrian Network (pednet) was created by the DAV team at the City of Toronto, and it is based on the sidewalk inventory from Transportation Services, Toronto road centrelines, and manual collection from aerial imagery. Pednet is integrated with centerline intersections, traffic signals, pedestrian crosswalks and crossovers, traffic signal data from Transportation Services as well as other City of Toronto datasets.\r\n\r\nPednet was built using a variety of open source libraries such as NetworkX, Pandana, Quantum GIS, and Space syntax, as well as production mapping tools from ESRI’s ArcPro/ArcMap. The project source code can be found on DAV’s GitHub account here, which includes the semi-automated offsetting method from the Sidewalk Inventory and the analytical procedures undertaken.\r\n\r\nPednet is a data model resembling a network graph (edges and nodes) weighted by linear distance. Shortest routes were calculated from every building centroid in the city to the nearest nth amenity at the maximum distance of 5000m. Walk times were calculated in the nearest minutes, using the prescribed 1.0m/per-second velocity used by Transportation services. Two separate versions of pednet were created in this iteration of the project: \r\n\r\n1) using actual linear distances as network weights, and \r\n\r\n2) where crosswalks were “extended” by 20% of their length to impose additional impedance to their distances and walk times. \r\n\r\nFor every address within the City of Toronto, the walk times were calculated to various amenities like schools, libraries, hospitals, supermarkets, TTC stops and convenience stores see Section 3. Walk times were assigned to individual addresses as attributes. We then aggregated all these walk times to the census tract level and calculated the minimum, maximum, standard deviation, median, and average walk times. We used these aggregated values to both: \r\n\r\n1) relate walkability measures to Statistics Canada Census data for socio-demographic analysis, as well as \r\n\r\n2) the building footprints, pednet centerlines, and census tract area boundaries to be used in choropleth maps contained within the following sections.",

      "description": "The City of Toronto hosted four online workshops in mid-September 2020 to gather feedback and recommendations from stakeholders on a proposed Transportation Innovation Zone (TIZ) program. The workshops had a total of 93 participants representing a wide range of organization types and interests. The workshops were hosted on the City's Webex Meetings web conferencing platform, and made use of the [GroupMap.com](https://www.groupmap.com/) online tool for collaborative idea rating on participant generated statements (ideas) in the form of questions and suggestions.  This dataset is the export of results from these four GroupMap sessions.\r\n\r\nFor more details on how the workshop was carried out and who participated, please see the TIZ Stakeholder Workshops Summary Reports under \"Consultation\"  [toronto.ca/tiz](https://www.toronto.ca/tiz).\r\n",

City of Toronto Neighbourhood Profiles use this Census data to provide a portrait of the demographic, social and economic characteristics of the people and households in each City of Toronto neighbourhood. The profiles present selected highlights from the data, but these accompanying data files provide the full data set assembled for each neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nFor an interactive visualization of this data, visit the [Neighbourhood Profiles webpage](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/neighbourhoods-communities/neighbourhood-profiles/).\r\n\r\nIn these profiles, \"neighbourhood\" refers to the City of Toronto's 158 social planning neighbourhoods. These social planning neighbourhoods were developed in the late 1990s by the City of Toronto to help government and community organizations with local planning by providing socio-economic data at a meaningful geographic area. The boundaries of these social planning neighbourhoods are consistent over time, allowing for comparison between Census years. Neighbourhood level indicators from sources other than the Census of Population are also available through the City's [Wellbeing Toronto](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/neighbourhoods-communities/wellbeing-toronto/) mapping application and here on the Open Data portal.\r\n\r\nEach data point in this file is presented for the City's 158 neighbourhoods or 140 neighbourhoods prior to April 2021. The data is sourced from a number of Census tables released by Statistics Canada. The general Census Profile is the main source table for this data. Data tables are available for the Census years of 2001, 2006, 2011, 2016, and 2021.   \r\n\r\nFor definitions of terms and concepts referenced in this data set, as well as limitations imposed by rounding, data suppression standards, and geometry, users should consult the reference materials produced by Statistics Canada for the [2016 Census](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/ref/index-eng.cfm) or the [2021 Census](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/ref/index-eng.cfm). Please note that social planning neighbourhoods are not an official standard geography produced by Statistics Canada and the data herein is compiled by special request through the [Community Data Program](https://communitydata.ca/).",

This data includes all shooting-related events reported to the Toronto Police Service, including, but not limited to, those that may have been deemed unfounded after investigation. Data is accurate as of the date and time of reporting.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, the Toronto Police Service has taken the necessary measures to protect the privacy of individuals involved in the reported occurrences. No personal information related to any of the parties involved in the occurrence will be released as open data. The data has been aggregated by year, category, subtype and geographic division.\r\n\r\nAs there is no criminal offence code for shootings, a shooting occurrence number may also be present in other data sets including, but not limited to, assault and robbery.\r\n\r\n<strong>Note:</strong> The further breakdown of this information at the event level will be made available in the future releases of the Shootings open data. \r\n\r\nShootings in this data set include both firearm discharges and shooting events, which are defined as follows:\r\n\r\n<strong>Shooting Event/Occurrence:</strong>   Any incident in which a projectile is discharged from a firearm (as defined under the Criminal Code of Canada) and injures a person. This excludes events such as suicide and police involved firearm discharges.\r\n\r\n<strong> Firearm Discharge: </strong> Any incident where evidence exists that a projectile was discharged from a firearm (as defined under the Criminal Code of Canada) including accidental discharge (non-police), celebratory fire, drive-by etc.\r\n\r\n<strong> Persons Injured (previously classified as “victims”):</strong>  A person who was struck by a bullet(s) as a result of the discharge of a firearm (as defined under the Criminal Code of Canada). This excludes events such as suicide, police-involved event or where the weapon used was not a real firearm (such as pellet gun, air pistol, “sim-munition” etc.)\r\n\r\n<u><strong>Injury Levels</strong></u>\r\n\r\n<strong> Death: </strong> Where the injured person (as defined above) has died as a result of injuries sustained from a bullet(s).\r\n<strong> Injuries:</strong>  Where the injured person (as defined above) has non-fatal physical injuries as a result of a bullet(s).\r\n\r\n\r\nThis data is related to table (ASR-SH-TBL-001) in [The Annual Statistical Report](https://data.torontopolice.on.ca/pages/annualstatisticalreport).\r\n\r\nAdditional information can be found [here](https://data.torontopolice.on.ca/pages/asr-resources).",

Included in the dataset is the name of the shelter, program name, sector served (i.e. men, women, youth, families) addresses, funded program capacity, and the number of people that occupied those spaces at 4:00 AM the next morning.\r\nFor example, the occupancy count of January 1st would be taken on January 2nd at 4 AM.\r\n\r\nThe reporting in this dataset has now been updated as a new open data set. This updated data set includes all overnight service programs administered by the Shelter, Support and Housing Administration division (e.g. 24-hour respites and COVID-19 hotel shelter programs) rather than just shelter programs. This new data set can be found [here](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/daily-shelter-overnight-service-occupancy-capacity/).\r\n\r\n__Note :__ For reasons of confidentiality, information regarding Violence Against Women shelters are removed from the dataset.\r\n\r\n__Please also note :__ During the COVID-19 pandemic response, shelter programs have undergone significant change. This dataset includes capacity data which are based on pre-existing funding arrangements with shelter providers, rather than the available capacity in the current COVID-19 circumstances. As programs implement physical distancing measures in their facilities, changes to program capacities often took some time to be reflected in this dataset. We advise users not to rely on capacity data to interpret current bed availability.\r\n\r\n",

TPH discontinued the production of this report with the final refresh as of February 14, 2024\r\n\r\nAs of February 2023, the fields \"currently hospitalized\", \"currently in ICU\" and \"currently intubated\" have been removed from the Open Data set. Due to current provincial guidelines on COVID-19 case management, discharge information is not always available. This makes it difficult to report accurately on these fields.  The time period for the inaccuracy is not known therefore data in these fields from previous downloads of the open data set should be interpreted with caution.\r\n\r\nAs of July 1, 2023, data entry practices will change to align with updated provincial guidance. TPH will no longer be entering: cases received only by fax and non-severe (not hospitalized or fatal) probable cases associated with outbreaks. This will likely result in an undercount when compared to previous COVID-19 case reporting.\r\n\r\nAs of November 27, 2023, deaths and hospitalization due to COVID are not being entered into CCM due to operational limitations.",
